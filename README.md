Programming Assignment 3-4

Create Java classes for Triangle, Rectangle, and Circle. Provide each class
with a method

public double computeArea()

Make all of these classes immutable. (Follow the guidelines in the slides for creating this
type of class.) Provide one constructor for each class; the constructor should accept the
data necessary to specify the figure, and to compute its area. The values accepted by the
constructor should be stored in (private) instance fields of the class. For example,
Rectangle should have instance fields width and length, and the constructor should
look like this

public Rectangle(double width, double length)

For Triangle, you may use arguments base and height. And for Circle, use
radius as the constructor arugment.

Whenever you create instance fields for one of these classes, provide public accessors for
them (but do not provide mutators since the class is supposed to be immutable â€“ for
instance, the dimensions of a Rectangle should be read-only). For example, you will
have in the Rectangle class:

private double width;
public double getWidth() {
return width;
}

Create a fourth class Main that will, in its main method, test these three figure classes as
follows: It will create one instance of each (you can make your own choice for the
dimensions of your figures) and then print to the console the area of each. Typical output
would be:

Area of Triangle is 34.75

Area of Rectangle is 36.0

Area of Circle is 58.57

Here are some area formulas, in case you do not remember them:

Area of a rectangle = width * height

Area of a triangle = 1/2 * base * height

Area of a circle = PI * radius * radius

Extra Credit! (Can get 15 points instead of 10). Create a second constructor to your
Triangle class that accepts three sides (instead of base and height). The constructor
should set the values of the sides as instance variables.

Design Tip. It is best to compute area of a triangle in just one way: (1/2) base * height.
This means that your new constructor, which accepts three sides, should compute the
base and the height (assume that the base is a longest side) using the input values for the
three sides. Then, when computeArea is called, it always returns (1/2)base*height.
To be consistent, your original constructor Triangle(double base, double
height) also needs to be modified so that it computes values for the three sides. Since
base and height do not give enough information to tell you precisely the lengths of the
three sides, make this assumption: One of the sides is the base, another is the height (and
you can compute the third).
