//Guidelines for creating an immutable class (from Bloch, Effective Java, 2nd ed.)
//        1-All fields should be private and final. This keeps internals private and prevents data from changing once the object is created.
//        2-Provide getters but no setters for all fields. Not providing setters is essential for making the class immutable.
//        3-Make the class final. (This prevents users of the class from accessing the internals of the class in another way â€“ to be discussed in Lesson 6.)
//        4-Make sure that getters do not return mutable objects.
